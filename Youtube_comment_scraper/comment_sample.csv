I wanted to mention Ben Franklins take on to much wealth.  His observations while in Europe with the wealthy was it was mostly detrimental. Which influenced His philosophy which was roughly:  once you have enough to support your family securely you should allocate most of your energy towards beneficial activities in society.

"14:19 the nation making Trans people an issue was only because Republicans and Tucker while on Fox made it one. Same goes for women‚Äôs rights and gay rights. Countries acting in their self interest means people within those countries will want to act in their self interest too. So I‚Äôm not following what Tucker is on about especially because ranting about Trans rights is exactly what he‚Äôs been crying about all these years.

This is ludicrous. They talk about prosperity being the problem when 1 in 5 kids in my country are living in POVERTY.  They need to get out in the world.  Stop talking about yourselves and genuinely  understand how luck has played a part in your lives (it explains 42% of entrpreneurial outcomes) as well as effort.

"Saw quite a few comments on X wanting more on OpenAI which is big news and understandable but I could not find one podcast that did not try to cover that. Gaming podcasts... podcasts that comment on Nintendo's mobile strategy and Netflix not using TV remotes as input devices commenting on the OpenAI drama. Dialogue and access to some of the most influential people is a very positive use of this platform, particularly when nuance does not exist in the majority of information we consume.",Ugxfj2wBIhkRbfIFqe54AaABAg,2

"Trucker is a master BS artist. His show was only about division...pointing the finger at the other side. In regard to what it means to be an American and Sacks comment around 1619 vs 1776....the issue is that the ""right"" will not allow that there were issues, and that the country had these issues.... for example, that major Army bases in the US were named after Confederate Generals, celebrating the Confederacy. That major portions of our history are ignored vs understood and used to make us better. Greatest example, the airport in Munich isn't named after Hitler or a Nazi General the way our major military installations were named after traitors to the US. Its the ""white washing"" that is the problem.",Ugx6fZiSOJn14EceeBN4AaABAg,2

"I can‚Äôt believe Jason and Friedberg (disregarding the one minor point of clarification you made, which really totally ignored every point both of them articulated) didn‚Äôt engage with Chamath and Sacks on anything they said.  That is the problem that I have with smart Democrats.   How can people claim to be enlightened or intelligent without the willingness to engage with those that are well meaning, well spoken, intelligent, well mannered individuals that happen to disagree with them on a political issue as large as denying the opposing party of their leading candidate for President? Is the action by the Colorado court indefensible, Jason? Your silence says so much more than your words in this instance ever could.  You are obfuscating any responsibility of the Democratic Party to justify their partisan hatchet job. I‚Äôm a man that helped get Dems elected to four terms in house and a term in the senate and this behavior is so far past disgusting that the Dems have forever lost my vote, this IS NOT WHAT AMERICA IS, SHOULD EVER BE. We are supposed to be the example. Trump left office, he didn‚Äôt barricade himself in the White House, the guy left.  What is wrong with all of you.  I mean Hillary IS STILL LITERALLY saying Trump stole the 2016 election because of Russian collusion that was of her creation.  The Republicans haven‚Äôt tried to disappear her like the soviets‚Ä¶.The hypocrisy is so thick i would need a nuclear weapon to break through it at this point.",UgxejME8agKSeMYfqIJ4AaABAg,0
