In regard to what it means to be an American and Sacks comment around 1619 vs 1776....the issue is that the ""right"" will not allow that there were issues, and that the country had these issues.... for example, that major Army bases in the US were named after Confederate Generals, celebrating the Confederacy. That major portions of our history are ignored vs understood and used to make us better.

"I can‚Äôt believe Jason and Friedberg (disregarding the one minor point of clarification you made, which really totally ignored every point both of them articulated) didn‚Äôt engage with Chamath and Sacks on anything they said.  That is the problem that I have with smart Democrats.   How can people claim to be enlightened or intelligent without the willingness to engage with those that are well meaning, well spoken, intelligent, well mannered individuals that happen to disagree with them on a political issue as large as denying the opposing party of their leading candidate for President? Is the action by the Colorado court indefensible, Jason? Your silence says so much more than your words in this instance ever could.  You are obfuscating any responsibility of the Democratic Party to justify their partisan hatchet job. I‚Äôm a man that helped get Dems elected to four terms in house and a term in the senate and this behavior is so far past disgusting that the Dems have forever lost my vote, this IS NOT WHAT AMERICA IS, SHOULD EVER BE. We are supposed to be the example. Trump left office, he didn‚Äôt barricade himself in the White House, the guy left.  What is wrong with all of you.  I mean Hillary IS STILL LITERALLY saying Trump stole the 2016 election because of Russian collusion that was of her creation.

"I'm a lender, not a Realtor, and you're wrong about what buyer Realtors do. They don't just schedule appointments. They also negotiate, educate, and counsel their clients to win bids in a competitive market. They work hard for weeks, months, or even years without pay until they close a deal. They help their clients cope with the stressful process of inspection, appraisal, and renegotiation. You have experts to guide you, but most people don't. They need their Realtor's advice and expertise. The average buyer Realtor in the US earns $86,000 a year. Without them, the real estate market will collapse. Buyers won't be able to afford the commission, and sellers won't have enough demand. More deals will fall through, and prices will drop creating more of a loss for the seller than if they had paid the negotiated commission. Plus, veterans won't be able to use their VA benefits, since the VA won‚Äôt let them pay for commissions.",Ugx4aNSEwJen714qjL94AaABAg,2

Germany's ""national socialist"" platform is the only system that addresses all of the concerns being expressed in conversations like these. Especially when you consider the benefits of one of its primary components, the abolition of usury, which enables an entire class of people to rapidly rise to the top by merely profiting off of the success of a small number of people, and off of the desperation and financial necessities of a much larger group of people.
