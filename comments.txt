Hold on, does Chamath just google things and pretend to be an expert/have strong opinions on the topic?
A guy I know had Hootie and the Blowfish play for his 50th.  They seemed pretty harmless
Good episode guys
Wonderful commentary, very informative.  Thank you.  People: ‚ÄúWhere do you get your news from?‚Äù, Me:‚ÄúOh, from the guys at All In‚Äù.     By the way, Tangle‚Äôs Isaac Saul pointed out that there are rumblings in TX to keep Biden off ballot now for his corruption intanglements.  Definitely a slippery slope on this Colorado decision.
Trump is anti war and thats his biggest selling point. With Biden everything is getting out of control.
Clearly pandering to the LGBTQ demo in the first 5 minutes.  Sacks, I'm so disappointed
If you dont have MLS its going to be more difficult .. because you'll just have fractured marketplaces all over the internet. You'll have to go to every brokers site to see their listings.
In re to NAR lawsuit it's a shame any validity to it and went to court. First off commissions are NEGOTIABLE. PERIOD. Secondly you do NOT need to use a broker to sell your home. Sell it yourself as a for sale by owner. No one is forcing you to pay commissions. And if you used a broker in any of those named cases you happily signed commission agreement. So why is this a problem.. one of you mentioned monopoly. Sell your house yourself without a broker. I thought monopoly meant you had no choice like cable companies back in the day. No one else provided you service to your house aside the company that owned territory correct? What a shame these attorneys are doing to the industry. And yes I use to be a broker but I provided flat rate listings similar to what you mentioned. So my point is you have choices and plenty of them. But most important  every single seller agreed to those commissions and now crying want money back. What a joke!
I love your podcast! It's so much fun and I even learn a few things I'll never use unless I play Trivial Pursuit.
LOL @ 26:55. Jason asks hey Jews(Sacks and Friedberg) have you been to Saudi Arabia? Watch their reactions.
Jcal must be making a fortune selling his virtual fugazzis in the middle east. His opinion on the region directly correlates with how he can pump to them rather than his usual clientele of functional alcoholic dentist's.
the FBI confirmed on Aug. 20, 2021 that Jan. 6th was not an insurrection. Im going to check in a while to see if my comment stays. When i state this fact my comment disappears.
I‚Äôve watched your show for the past 4 years since the first pre covid episode. I love to learn about topics in business and technology outside my area of expertise. Hearing your discussion the real estate market opened my eyes to how your level of expertise on the variety of topics you discuss every week is a clear spectrum. You guys must have had terrible experiences with real estate brokers who didnt bring the value and service my small team brings to its 250 annual clients. We network for a living and connect people with Job opportunities when moving to town. We find off market properties and play match maker between buyer and seller. We are a hub for all of the business activity around real estate with all trade contractors. We educate first time home buyers and help them find the best loan products and areas for investment. We negotiate contracts through inspections and appraisal contingencies. We act as a fiduciary  and get our clients the best deal. If they are moving to our market we teach them everything they need to know about the subdivisions, hoa‚Äôs, and school districts. And, we do this making $0 until closing. If your goal isn‚Äôt accomplished then we get paid nothing. So we take all of the risk as a 1099 self employed person with no benefits. Also, the customary commission percentage is built into the price of the market. If a lower commission is offered then a lower sale price is expected. The seller really pays nothing but they have the expense listed on their side of the settlement statement. It‚Äôs really the buyer that pays for everything, because without a buyer there is no money afterall. I think your software should eat everything mentality ingrained from the industries you specialize shows your clear bias often harder to parse out in discussions of politics or venture capital. I love the pod but thought your takes on this discussion to be flat and short sighted. Merry Christmas!
As an adobe customer I‚Äôm annoyed by the Figma deal falling through. Adobe has one of the best Subscription models in terms of bang for your buck. I don‚Äôt want to pay another figure/subscription to another company. Monopolies can be beneficial for customers especially in the creative community space who are notoriously underpaid and lack coin. Something I don‚Äôt think the SEC has taken into account.
Greatest podcast ever
vote for Niki Haley
The real estate take is incorrect on a few things factually. Also realtors do bring more value than data entry to MLS
Jcal has TDS so bad ..
Great show! JCal shilling Bharara's pod as balanced is hilarious. He's an establishment Dem working for partisan CNN w/ a vendetta at Trump for firing him. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
What happened to JCals take on Colorado?  Edited out?
