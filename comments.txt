In re to NAR lawsuit it's a shame any validity to it and went to court. First off commissions are NEGOTIABLE. PERIOD. Secondly you do NOT need to use a broker to sell your home. Sell it yourself as a for sale by owner. No one is forcing you to pay commissions. And if you used a broker in any of those named cases you happily signed commission agreement. So why is this a problem.. one of you mentioned monopoly. Sell your house yourself without a broker. I thought monopoly meant you had no choice like cable companies back in the day. No one else provided you service to your house aside the company that owned territory correct? What a shame these attorneys are doing to the industry. And yes I use to be a broker but I provided flat rate listings similar to what you mentioned. So my point is you have choices and plenty of them. But most important  every single seller agreed to those commissions and now crying want money back. What a joke!	UgxKz5ClG31BXmiMiQ14AaABAg

I‚Äôve watched your show for the past 4 years since the first pre covid episode. I love to learn about topics in business and technology outside my area of expertise. Hearing your discussion the real estate market opened my eyes to how your level of expertise on the variety of topics you discuss every week is a clear spectrum. You guys must have had terrible experiences with real estate brokers who didnt bring the value and service my small team brings to its 250 annual clients. We network for a living and connect people with Job opportunities when moving to town. We find off market properties and play match maker between buyer and seller. We are a hub for all of the business activity around real estate with all trade contractors. We educate first time home buyers and help them find the best loan products and areas for investment. We negotiate contracts through inspections and appraisal contingencies. We act as a fiduciary  and get our clients the best deal. If they are moving to our market we teach them everything they need to know about the subdivisions, hoa‚Äôs, and school districts. And, we do this making $0 until closing. If your goal isn‚Äôt accomplished then we get paid nothing. So we take all of the risk as a 1099 self employed person with no benefits. Also, the customary commission percentage is built into the price of the market. If a lower commission is offered then a lower sale price is expected. The seller really pays nothing but they have the expense listed on their side of the settlement statement. It‚Äôs really the buyer that pays for everything, because without a buyer there is no money afterall. I think your software should eat everything mentality ingrained from the industries you specialize shows your clear bias often harder to parse out in discussions of politics or venture capital. I love the pod but thought your takes on this discussion to be flat and short sighted. Merry Christmas!	UgzTUOephMqHylPvIbN4AaABAg

Somewhat chilling that Sachs says the only 3 outcomes for a startup: 1. Get Acquired 2. IPO 3. Go out of business. 

What about option 4: A startup has value where it slowly builds and makes money on merit and can stand on its own two feet. Perhaps 1 and 2 aren't so to be viable so often for the money supply to perform properly and not go into hyper inflation mode. If normal people are living in the same world of only option 1 and 2 making sense...then there seems to be a lack of government oversight on these false valuations people are using in options 1 and 2.

The ability to run for president is absolutely not a symbol of liberty ‚Äî it‚Äôs one of the most (rightly and intentionally) restrictive rights in the USA. You have to be a person of exceptional standing to be allowed to run and even the biggest fans of Trump (two hosts). 

And Sacks‚Äôs ‚Äúthis is restricting every citizen‚Äôs right to vote‚Äù is a horrific rhetoric because it feels intuitive but is wrong. Thousands of people have been disqualified to run and it‚Äôs nothing to do with people‚Äôs right to vote ‚Äî it‚Äôs to do with their right to run.	UgzEE_YkG2_uTLhVuyt4AaABAg

I agree that the final vote should be with the people not the courts, but It sounds as if in order to "save democracy and our system of law", we must give Trump the presidency, because the Democrats were stupid enough to pursue indictment of him for things he had actually done, but were sort of not against the law. He can then take the next four years getting even with all his business, political and personal enemies who, he has told us, are also our enemies. (Being a Democrat that would mean that my enemy is myself.)  So, a man who has not a single ounce of humility will use the power the American people will have bestowed upon him, not judiciously as any moral leader would do (he is Trump after all),  but will give his followers the biggest retribution party they could ask for. Batten down the White House!  I can hear the AR15s going off all over America. All political corruption will immediately stop.  The woke mentality will be banished from existence.  People south of the US border will live happily ever after in the country of their origin.  The Palestinians will listen to reason and begin to love the Jews. Ukraine will be given back to the Ukrainians as a gift from Putin to Trump.  And lastly the man of 6 well-documented bankruptcies will solve the national debt problem.	UgwvxW0sIdsvJCoiX8R4AaABAg

We have bought two houses without agents‚Ä¶ one was years ago as a ‚Äúcontract for deed‚Äù transaction and the second was because I saw a house while at a yard sale and told the owner to contact me when she as ready‚Ä¶ I got a call some months later asking if I was still interested‚Ä¶ we closed at a title office and I secured my mortgage at my bank. Further we sold the first house direct without an agent‚Ä¶ we just put a sign in the yard ‚Äúfor sale by owner‚Äù‚Ä¶ it sold in a week. Another technique used often when credit is tight is where the seller takes back a second mortgage i rent with option to buy offer‚Ä¶ both require contracts best handled by an attorney‚Ä¶ the attorney fee is much less than a realtor commission.

Prior to interest rates going up, in many markets there were multiple offers on homes. In Bellevue WA, we are talking 10 to 20 offers. A really good buyers agent can make all the difference on convincing the sellers to accept an offer even when it isn‚Äôt the highest offer. Good agents are also solid psychologists because many buyers and sellers can be emotional and do stupid things based on what the other party may do. You all are sophisticated buyers and investors with large capital allocations but most are not.	UgwWfROL5b-ovZEmjV54AaABAg
I don't see how the Democratic party is all of a sudden the authoritarian party when the Republican party for a long time now has tried every way possible to circumvent the democratic process by gerrymandering,  trying to exclude demographic groups from voting, and favoring deep pockets to unduly influencing elections.

Great podcast. However Chamath is wrong about reason for lack of IPO's.  It doesnt matter how many analysts you have covering stocks, as their recommendations isn't going to solve this.  And  Investment Banks havent  underwritten Capital market transactions since the Financial Crisis. The problem is investors have moved to index investing. So if the stock isnt in an index there is no demand.  IPO's dont go in the index so we are in a circular reference.	UgwsuMVL-X2h6Ojm5fd4AaABAg

you got several things wrong regarding the current practices in the Real Estate industry. FSBOs websites are NOT real estate agencies. Friedberg is confusing them with Flat Fees brokerages. They are two different things. Both useful.  Also the main value the *few good* sell-side agent provides is at selling for more than you would do on you own, and the *few good* buy side agent is not at opening doors, but at actually writing the offer and representing your interests. Even though the money comes from the seller, all homes pay the same commission so good agents actually DO represent the buyer‚Äôs interest. As they can make the same money in ANY home they sell to you and are motivated by getting the buyer to refer more business to them. I‚Äôm developing an MVP to connect people with the agents who have the *most relevant* experience based on past transactions they‚Äôve closed recently (MLS data) and the client‚Äôs location/price-specific goals.  bootstrapping for now.  üòä	UgwHCVippe7ti_ucfSN4AaABAg

As a realtor for over twenty years, When the market is easy like when Friedberg and Jason sold their home and have buyers already lined up to buy, then I would say negotiate fees with realtor or  get attorney , because issues can still arise for both seller and buyer. Buyer brokers protect the buyer from overpaying , finding financing, help with due diligence, and help resolve issues that could kill a deal if an experienced agent isn‚Äôt there to help. Currently , with limited inventory and rates so high buyers really need  help with even finding a home. Therefore, Buyer agents can work with a buyer for a lot longer then a selling agent. Many Buyers , also , can‚Äôt find a  home that meets their needs , or don‚Äôt have market expertise , or can‚Äôt make up their minds to what type of property they really want or cost involved in owning a condo vs single family. The seller agent is not there to protect the buyer. Also, The selling broker cannot be a fiduciary to both seller and buyer.	UgxCx50AHieTWig7VXd4AaABAg

I LOVE how the entirety of the Left completely ignores that Trump has never been charged with Insurrection, let alone convicted.  Furthermore, they've never shown me a single piece of evidence that Trump did commit insurrection.  It is the Conservatives who DO show proof that Trump did NOT take actions of an insurrectionists, such as telling everyone to be peaceful and respect law and order.  It was the LEFTISTS who censored those communications from Trump because they WANTED violence.  The entire thing is a farce and a fedsurrection.

There is so much wrong with the real estate conversation that these guys had in this pod. Can't even begin to set the record straight...geez, talk about getting too far out over your skis, holy moly. Yes, I am a broker. Please understand - I am totally cool with agents going away, I will make a lot more money when they do away with the real estate licensing. So many potholes to step in with transactions. Legal descriptions, surveys, home inspections, appraisals, etc. All these parts are moments where you need clarity, understanding, negotiating ability, and an advocate. When buyer agents go away, buyers will not be prepared as well; also, values will go down. When buyers don't know what to do, they won't transact...kills demand, values go down.

Pertaining to the real estate section, I‚Äôve been a real estate broker for about 10 years and the company I work under has used Buyer Broker Agreements since I started and I assume way before I started. Buyers brokers have way more job duties aside from just scheduling showings. 
As for who pays the commissions, the BUYER has always paid commissions. The seller does not have the money to pay any commissions until the BUYER brings the funds to the table. Then from the proceeds of the sale, the compensation gets paid. Without a buyer bringing the funds to the table, the seller has no funds to pay any fees at all	UgxoCUh_LW3UBF5KI454AaABAg

I‚Äôm a realtor in Austin. NAR definitely needs to go away. There‚Äôs certainly a conflict of interest for buyer agent. I think it should be a retention fee and a flat fee at the end for buyer agent. However I‚Äôd say most work done on a transaction is by buyers agent. Listing agents spend 80% of their time and marketing effort on cultivating relationships with potential home sellers than actually selling homes. Real estate is heavily relationship based. I‚Äôve had offered 1% to sell homes but it really didn‚Äôt bring me anymore business than offering 3%. Sellers rather pay 3% to a realtor friend who they can trust.	UgxuZRetGgz8HOwK4jZ4AaABAg

Buzz from conservatives about the Colorado ruling seems to be pretty subdued atm.

After the Whitmer and J6 set-ups it strikes me that perhaps the purpose of the CO case/ruling is not to stand legally, but to provide a trigger for people the FBI is inciting to commit violence.

Calling American workers ‚Äúentitled‚Äù might be fair and true, but to a degree it‚Äôs also gaslighting in the context it‚Äôs used here. The cost of living here, especially factoring in health care costs, is higher than a lot of the other countries they mentioned.

There is a buyer broker agreement to sign with the buyer, which will become more used since the lawsuit.  If you get rid of the buyer agent, you will have a monopoly because then the listing agent will have a higher probability of representing both sides.  Most buyers can‚Äôt afford buying a home and paying their agent a commission.  That agent orders inspections, explains the process and protects the buyer by helping them understand what they are buying.  There is value.  Also in the Bay Area average commissions in the bay area is 5% 2.5/2.5.	UgyoK5mvoauo7b0mD5l4AaABAg

30:40 They speak of radical solutions to peace in the middle east...¬† War is the answer currently, and Jason is laughed off the mic for suggesting financial and/or diplomatic solutions...¬†


Ill just add the last impossible and hilarious solution to this problem!¬†¬†


A solution so common that we use it everyday.¬† Yet considered so hilariously impossible that it doesn't even get mentioned in the discussion here.¬†


The solution is radical forgiveness.¬†


We do this everyday in so many ways.


Forgiveness ends conflict.¬†


In forgiveness, we both agree to forgive and forget.¬†¬†


Maybe this time i was wrong.

maybe last time it was you.¬†¬†


An acceptance that we've both been hurting each other for so long that a proper accounting is impossible and that the only way forward is a reset.¬†¬†


It's how things get settled to a point where a mutually trustworthy relationship can be given a chance to grow. ¬† It's how people who truly love each other stay in long term marriages.¬†


Yet-¬† How this concept applies at this level is somehow impossible to imagine!¬†

The entire concept is unexplorable, unthinkable, ludicrous!¬†


So if we are laughing at ideas... Let me throw that one in the hat and we can have a puke inducing laugh attack.	UgwekZhYvKygVNz0ekZ4AaABAg

I'm a lender, not a Realtor, and you're wrong about what buyer Realtors do. They don't just schedule appointments. They also negotiate, educate, and counsel their clients to win bids in a competitive market. They work hard for weeks, months, or even years without pay until they close a deal. They help their clients cope with the stressful process of inspection, appraisal, and renegotiation. You have experts to guide you, but most people don't. They need their Realtor's advice and expertise. The average buyer Realtor in the US earns $86,000 a year. Without them, the real estate market will collapse. Buyers won't be able to afford the commission, and sellers won't have enough demand. More deals will fall through, and prices will drop creating more of a loss for the seller than if they had paid the negotiated commission. Plus, veterans won't be able to use their VA benefits, since the VA won‚Äôt let them pay for commissions.	Ugx4aNSEwJen714qjL94AaABAg

The practical reality is that the EU is sliding into recession. Germany has been in recession for 2 quarters already and the situation is only getting worse. China already knows that trade will be diminished due to these recessionary influences. As such demand for shipping will decline with capacity becoming far greater than the actual demand. Any increase in cost pressures resulting from the activities of the Houthis will be offset by the decline in demand.

To solve this problem, it will be much easier to get rid of the Netanyahu government than to get rid of the Houthis.	Ugyq8D6HKCswlYB0W814AaABAg

JCal referring to the inevitable uprising against a brutal occupation that made South Africa's apartheid look like a picnic, and the ensuing genocidal reprisal as a 'skirmish'. Houthis are staging a humanitarian intervention to stop a genocide, or at the very least, ethnic cleansing, where disease and starvation are being weaponized, while the West and GCC countries (apart from Qatar) want to return to the prior status quo occupation, and forget about the brutality of Israel and the plight of the Palestinians.

The Houthi issue rises from the Israel-Gaza conflict. The larger world powers and the UN need to contain these conflicts. The West needs to control Israel, theyre a tiny state and a teenager in comparison. The Arabs needs to control Hamas and make them back down immediately. Think of the people in Gaza who live in a Warsaw Ghetto like conditions and dont connect them with Hamas- they had no choice. 2 million people living in a 141 sqm area. The coalition against the Houthis is laughable, with countries like Aus and Europen countries sending 5 to 10 soldiers each.

I can‚Äôt believe Jason and Friedberg (disregarding the one minor point of clarification you made, which really totally ignored every point both of them articulated) didn‚Äôt engage with Chamath and Sacks on anything they said.  That is the problem that I have with smart Democrats.   How can people claim to be enlightened or intelligent without the willingness to engage with those that are well meaning, well spoken, intelligent, well mannered individuals that happen to disagree with them on a political issue as large as denying the opposing party of their leading candidate for President? Is the action by the Colorado court indefensible, Jason? Your silence says so much more than your words in this instance ever could.  You are obfuscating any responsibility of the Democratic Party to justify their partisan hatchet job. I‚Äôm a man that helped get Dems elected to four terms in house and a term in the senate and this behavior is so far past disgusting that the Dems have forever lost my vote, this IS NOT WHAT AMERICA IS, SHOULD EVER BE. We are supposed to be the example. Trump left office, he didn‚Äôt barricade himself in the White House, the guy left.  What is wrong with all of you.  I mean Hillary IS STILL LITERALLY saying Trump stole the 2016 election because of Russian collusion that was of her creation.  The Republicans haven‚Äôt tried to disappear her like the soviets‚Ä¶.The hypocrisy is so thick i would need a nuclear weapon to break through it at this point.	UgxejME8agKSeMYfqIJ4AaABAg

Love you gentlemen big fan definitely a must listen, but you over simplified the real estate market. Like you I don‚Äôt really have skin in the game as I will get paid whether realtors pay me or private clients do.. we provide the great media that brings foot traffic to the door. Zillow, Red f*rt, all want to use the MLS system which is the only proven system to sell your home, those services are just leech services that provide very little benefit. The MLS system is paid for by the realtors, it is what makes that system work throughout North America. All these cheap people Dani want the benefits of the mls  without paying for it they feel like they are entitled to have access to the system for almost zero money. The system was built for and by realtors and works extremely well. The reason the buyer agent gets paid by the seller is because they work really hard drive to show 30 properties all over the city or area costs time and money. Now I am sure they could set up like lawyers an hourly system that the buyers client pays but it will not be cheap either. A good realtor will sell the home for a good 10% above what the 1% cowboys out there.. they market the property extremely well through their brokerages and to other brokerages.. and there is a lot of admin cost and safe guarding of the clients interests along the way. Even with a good lawyer they only see what is on paper and submitted there are so many pitfalls in real estate that the realtors and their collective in the brokerage understand through experience in processing thousands of sales a year. I really don‚Äôt get why people want to cheap on on for most their biggest assets‚Ä¶ you definitely get what you pay for. My agent on my home on the buyer side we were competing with 8 others in the buying process and it was because of realtors knowledge that we ended up winning on offer night. His direct knowledge not only saved us money.. it blew out the competition, because the selling agent was a 1% wonder and didn‚Äôt realize the water treatment system was not a rental it was a finance.. so my realtor in the first couple of rounds didn‚Äôt mention it.. we never upped our first offer, and in the third round as it is a blind build the cowboy realtor who was trying to double end the deal without disclosing that he was bringing in a buyer.. tried to get us to up the offer that is when my realtor dropped the hammer on them, and we closed the deal as his buyer backed out in the final round. Having worked also at a top Toronto brokerage for a decade as their senior marketer I understand the insider knowledge of what goes on and how valuable top realtors are and top brokerages too. Everyone wants everything for free.. especially those folks like you gentlemen who have money to burn from my knowledge you folks are the cheapest (no offence) - definitely knew Freiburg would‚Äôve been one to go that route. For a proper deal to get done there is so much admin work to get done properly and be triple verified by a brokerage.. way before it even heads to a lawyer. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that FSBO to anyone with their largest assets you will get burnt and people are litagious you will lose everything. Not that long ago we had home the gov mess with our market a few dum dumbs that thought by not closing the deal that they would only lose their down payment. In the end a whole group of people lost 400 to 600K and had to rent for backing out of a deal. They were too smart and wouldn‚Äôt listen to their realtors. I appreciate that in you gentlemen‚Äôs cases you might already know some people that would like to buy your property as you work in a certain societal circle, but good realtors and brokerages will bring in clients from all over the world not just the local market. Those leeches in the market like Zerow and Redtard like to charge realtors extra and photographers and basically milk everyone for using the MLS system through them, I personally wouldn‚Äôt deal with any of them it is the realtors and MLS that are going to bring you the listings in the end and the realtors are on straight commission they don‚Äôt sell no one gets paid. Now as the property owner them raising your assets price is a good thing not a bad thing. Yes you need to be able to afford to purchase but once you have your foot in the door and are generating equity you want your assets to go up and value so that your investment grows. Would you gentlemen investing in VC work hard if you could not profit, there has to be a reward for expertise and knowledge, or why build businesses? Now I appreciate you gentlemen are in the US and your market is sketchy in many areas mostly because of your banking, state, and fed rules etc.. but in Canada Real Estate is highly regulated, the banking system is extremely safe.. so it is one of the greatest investments going. Without great realtors houses would sit, people in trouble would lose everything, and you would rely on faceless Tech companies who could give a crap as long as they are monopolizing with their own system and profiting. They could care less about the realtors buyers or sellers as long as they milk their chunk from you, and at the end of the day when Zerow becomes king they would jack you with rates till we would be back to where you started but with someone who is not only incentivized to sell your property but to also get you the most amount of money they can. Why do buyers agents get paid also.. because they actually work harder than the selling agent. Some of their clients they have to show 30 homes to before they change their mind and want a place on the opposite side of town. Anyways that is my two cents.. like I said.. for me it doesn‚Äôt make a difference except that realtors will have your place ready to photos video and scan and I don‚Äôt have to charge return fees because the place was not ready to capture media. Usually it is staged too, cleaned, inspected. But then again if you don‚Äôt work with a realtor I will just charge more because of your incompetence as it will take us more time on site to do anything.	UgygADoe0lSXxXC5reZ4AaABAg

The segment were they talked about Trump being taken away from the ballot forgot to mention the global impact. America can no longer be viewed as a credible source for any sort of Democracy worldwide and anyone who is currently our ally must be looking at the past few news cycles of America from the President about to be tried for impeachment, his son skipping congressional meetings, coke being found in the white house, sex tapes being taken in the white house, and now leading political opponents being stricken form the ballots.

It was rarely 6%. The market had already been naturally compressing. It‚Äôs been 5% for a while and many areas under 4%, total comp. Assume 50/50.

If you already have a buyer directly, you can always structure it directly with them. This is not a market driven approach and only for both sides that are experienced. These guys are hundred millionaire/billionaires, so they have the resources out of their own pocket to do these things. Also, how is the other so sure that the price of the home was fair? You think at the price of their homes over $5m, a professional knows more than them of the market? There is a reason why their price range still has a majority of people use agents to structure and analyze deals/disclosures.

Buyers and sellers always have choices. This is exactly how Redfin started as being a discount brokerage. How did they sustain this? They pay their agents a salary. Their issue is always talent. Why would the best agents work for a flat/ low salary? None of these guys pay any of their sales people a flat low salary in any of their companies.	UgwuZEOFhBU3-0u0XPx4AaABAg

Classic Jcal - quotes 'lawfare' podcast as 'balanced' - its fine if its a leftist activist who actually drove the CO case and are gloating in the win but how did they become 'balanced' ? Shouldn't that be an unconflicted observer by definition?	UgynN6lx0Y2FNyTN1Th4AaABAg

What are prices coming down on, sorry?  I still feel like everything is extremely expensive.  If we cut rates next year won‚Äôt prices just balloon again?	UgzvcrBvKXuqhxaSgq54AaABAg
The US has no intention to stop any of these proxies....why would they when the flow of arms to Saudi is a valuable revenue stream. Chamath is obsolutely correct in saying SA is tired of all these wars bogging them down when they feel investment in other areas is crucial. China's able to weather this storm because their goods will continue to flow at the cost to the consumers in Europe and eventually people will want a resolution adding more pressure on Israel. Great episode with valuable content as usual.	UgxGjzt7jJdxzufiA1p4AaABAg

1:34:00 It doesn't take a genius to see these attacks are helping Trump. So why are the democrats still attacking him, knowing fully well that Supreme Court will overturn the Colorado decision? Obviously because *they want* Trump to be the Republican nominee. Why him? Because Trump is the only candidate people hate as much as Biden.	UgwdcSEnIf81TeeE-lF4AaABAg

if the houthi's condition for peace is to allow aid into gaza, the quick resolution would be to agree to that.  chamath somehow convinced himself that we just need to "take care of" hamas and the houthis.  Sacks is right about being dovish here.	UgxUwnwsAo1XcDEMAUR4AaABAg

Supreme Court has already made clear in a previous case that an Officer under the 14A, is someone the President Appoints, and therefore the President is NOT an officer. Dude, this is the easiest case the Supreme Court can rule on. A first year law student could argue it	Ugy9XJz29zJwMG8HZ754AaABAg

Hmm. As a Broker I can see a ton of lawsuits coming down if home owners start selling their own homes.  People already sue indiscriminately in housing. Everyone knows commissions are negotiable. Only bad or new agents negotiate because agents know people who negotiate will squeeze the life out of you. You also have to understand, one deal could make an agents year. Agents getting paid for all the free work they do which is a lot!	UgybkQVZm22dY2onE6h4AaABAg

One thing that isn't mentioned is technically Adobe was going to buy Figma for $30 BILLION because they initially offered $20B of half stock and cash, and the stock has rallied 100% since September 22'.
