In re to NAR lawsuit it's a shame any validity to it and went to court. First off commissions are NEGOTIABLE. PERIOD. Secondly you do NOT need to use a broker to sell your home. Sell it yourself as a for sale by owner. No one is forcing you to pay commissions. And if you used a broker in any of those named cases you happily signed commission agreement. So why is this a problem.. one of you mentioned monopoly. Sell your house yourself without a broker. I thought monopoly meant you had no choice like cable companies back in the day. No one else provided you service to your house aside the company that owned territory correct? What a shame these attorneys are doing to the industry. And yes I use to be a broker but I provided flat rate listings similar to what you mentioned. So my point is you have choices and plenty of them. But most important  every single seller agreed to those commissions and now crying want money back. What a joke!,UgxKz5ClG31BXmiMiQ14AaABAg

"I‚Äôve watched your show for the past 4 years since the first pre covid episode. I love to learn about topics in business and technology outside my area of expertise. Hearing your discussion the real estate market opened my eyes to how your level of expertise on the variety of topics you discuss every week is a clear spectrum. You guys must have had terrible experiences with real estate brokers who didnt bring the value and service my small team brings to its 250 annual clients. We network for a living and connect people with Job opportunities when moving to town. We find off market properties and play match maker between buyer and seller. We are a hub for all of the business activity around real estate with all trade contractors. We educate first time home buyers and help them find the best loan products and areas for investment. We negotiate contracts through inspections and appraisal contingencies. We act as a fiduciary  and get our clients the best deal. If they are moving to our market we teach them everything they need to know about the subdivisions, hoa‚Äôs, and school districts. And, we do this making $0 until closing. If your goal isn‚Äôt accomplished then we get paid nothing. So we take all of the risk as a 1099 self employed person with no benefits. Also, the customary commission percentage is built into the price of the market. If a lower commission is offered then a lower sale price is expected. The seller really pays nothing but they have the expense listed on their side of the settlement statement. It‚Äôs really the buyer that pays for everything, because without a buyer there is no money afterall. I think your software should eat everything mentality ingrained from the industries you specialize shows your clear bias often harder to parse out in discussions of politics or venture capital. I love the pod but thought your takes on this discussion to be flat and short sighted. Merry Christmas!",UgzTUOephMqHylPvIbN4AaABAg

What about option 4: A startup has value where it slowly builds and makes money on merit and can stand on its own two feet. Perhaps 1 and 2 aren't so to be viable so often for the money supply to perform properly and not go into hyper inflation mode.

"I agree that the final vote should be with the people not the courts, but It sounds as if in order to ""save democracy and our system of law"", we must give Trump the presidency, because the Democrats were stupid enough to pursue indictment of him for things he had actually done, but were sort of not against the law. He can then take the next four years getting even with all his business, political and personal enemies who, he has told us, are also our enemies. (Being a Democrat that would mean that my enemy is myself.)  So, a man who has not a single ounce of humility will use the power the American people will have bestowed upon him, not judiciously as any moral leader would do (he is Trump after all),  but will give his followers the biggest retribution party they could ask for. Batten down the White House!  I can hear the AR15s going off all over America. All political corruption will immediately stop.  The woke mentality will be banished from existence.  People south of the US border will live happily ever after in the country of their origin.  The Palestinians will listen to reason and begin to love the Jews. Ukraine will be given back to the Ukrainians as a gift from Putin to Trump.  And lastly the man of 6 well-documented bankruptcies will solve the national debt problem.",UgwvxW0sIdsvJCoiX8R4AaABAg

We have bought two houses without agents‚Ä¶ one was years ago as a ‚Äúcontract for deed‚Äù transaction and the second was because I saw a house while at a yard sale and told the owner to contact me when she as ready‚Ä¶ I got a call some months later asking if I was still interested‚Ä¶ we closed at a title office and I secured my mortgage at my bank. Further we sold the first house direct without an agent‚Ä¶ we just put a sign in the yard ‚Äúfor sale by owner‚Äù‚Ä¶ it sold in a week. Another technique used often when credit is tight is where the seller takes back a second mortgage i rent with option to buy offer‚Ä¶ both require contracts best handled by an attorney‚Ä¶ the attorney fee is much less than a realtor commission.,UgwUGpzMxdZtTBLYLBJ4AaABAg

"you got several things wrong regarding the current practices in the Real Estate industry. FSBOs websites are NOT real estate agencies. Friedberg is confusing them with Flat Fees brokerages. They are two different things. Both useful.  Also the main value the *few good* sell-side agent provides is at selling for more than you would do on you own, and the *few good* buy side agent is not at opening doors, but at actually writing the offer and representing your interests. Even though the money comes from the seller, all homes pay the same commission so good agents actually DO represent the buyer‚Äôs interest. As they can make the same money in ANY home they sell to you and are motivated by getting the buyer to refer more business to them.

"As a realtor for over twenty years, When the market is easy like when Friedberg and Jason sold their home and have buyers already lined up to buy, then I would say negotiate fees with realtor or  get attorney , because issues can still arise for both seller and buyer. Buyer brokers protect the buyer from overpaying , finding financing, help with due diligence, and help resolve issues that could kill a deal if an experienced agent isn‚Äôt there to help. Currently , with limited inventory and rates so high buyers really need  help with even finding a home. Therefore, Buyer agents can work with a buyer for a lot longer then a selling agent. Many Buyers , also , can‚Äôt find a  home that meets their needs , or don‚Äôt have market expertise , or can‚Äôt make up their minds to what type of property they really want or cost involved in owning a condo vs single family. The seller agent is not there to protect the buyer. Also, The selling broker cannot be a fiduciary to both seller and buyer.",UgxCx50AHieTWig7VXd4AaABAg

I‚Äôm a realtor in Austin. NAR definitely needs to go away. There‚Äôs certainly a conflict of interest for buyer agent. I think it should be a retention fee and a flat fee at the end for buyer agent. However I‚Äôd say most work done on a transaction is by buyers agent. Listing agents spend 80% of their time and marketing effort on cultivating relationships with potential home sellers than actually selling homes. Real estate is heavily relationship based. I‚Äôve had offered 1% to sell homes but it really didn‚Äôt bring me anymore business than offering 3%. Sellers rather pay 3% to a realtor friend who they can trust.,UgxuZRetGgz8HOwK4jZ4AaABAg

"I'm a lender, not a Realtor, and you're wrong about what buyer Realtors do. They don't just schedule appointments. They also negotiate, educate, and counsel their clients to win bids in a competitive market. They work hard for weeks, months, or even years without pay until they close a deal. They help their clients cope with the stressful process of inspection, appraisal, and renegotiation. You have experts to guide you, but most people don't. They need their Realtor's advice and expertise. The average buyer Realtor in the US earns $86,000 a year. Without them, the real estate market will collapse. Buyers won't be able to afford the commission, and sellers won't have enough demand. More deals will fall through, and prices will drop creating more of a loss for the seller than if they had paid the negotiated commission. Plus, veterans won't be able to use their VA benefits, since the VA won‚Äôt let them pay for commissions.",Ugx4aNSEwJen714qjL94AaABAg

"Love you gentlemen big fan definitely a must listen, but you over simplified the real estate market. Like you I don‚Äôt really have skin in the game as I will get paid whether realtors pay me or private clients do.. we provide the great media that brings foot traffic to the door. Zillow, Red f*rt, all want to use the MLS system which is the only proven system to sell your home, those services are just leech services that provide very little benefit. The MLS system is paid for by the realtors, it is what makes that system work throughout North America. All these cheap people Dani want the benefits of the mls  without paying for it they feel like they are entitled to have access to the system for almost zero money. The system was built for and by realtors and works extremely well. The reason the buyer agent gets paid by the seller is because they work really hard drive to show 30 properties all over the city or area costs time and money. Now I am sure they could set up like lawyers an hourly system that the buyers client pays but it will not be cheap either. A good realtor will sell the home for a good 10% above what the 1% cowboys out there.. they market the property extremely well through their brokerages and to other brokerages.. and there is a lot of admin cost and safe guarding of the clients interests along the way. Even with a good lawyer they only see what is on paper and submitted there are so many pitfalls in real estate that the realtors and their collective in the brokerage understand through experience in processing thousands of sales a year. I really don‚Äôt get why people want to cheap on on for most their biggest assets‚Ä¶ you definitely get what you pay for. My agent on my home on the buyer side we were competing with 8 others in the buying process and it was because of realtors knowledge that we ended up winning on offer night. His direct knowledge not only saved us money.. it blew out the competition, because the selling agent was a 1% wonder and didn‚Äôt realize the water treatment system was not a rental it was a finance.. so my realtor in the first couple of rounds didn‚Äôt mention it.. we never upped our first offer, and in the third round as it is a blind build the cowboy realtor who was trying to double end the deal without disclosing that he was bringing in a buyer.. tried to get us to up the offer that is when my realtor dropped the hammer on them, and we closed the deal as his buyer backed out in the final round. Having worked also at a top Toronto brokerage for a decade as their senior marketer I understand the insider knowledge of what goes on and how valuable top realtors are and top brokerages too. Everyone wants everything for free.. especially those folks like you gentlemen who have money to burn from my knowledge you folks are the cheapest (no offence) - definitely knew Freiburg would‚Äôve been one to go that route. For a proper deal to get done there is so much admin work to get done properly and be triple verified by a brokerage.. way before it even heads to a lawyer. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that FSBO to anyone with their largest assets you will get burnt and people are litagious you will lose everything. Not that long ago we had home the gov mess with our market a few dum dumbs that thought by not closing the deal that they would only lose their down payment. In the end a whole group of people lost 400 to 600K and had to rent for backing out of a deal. They were too smart and wouldn‚Äôt listen to their realtors. I appreciate that in you gentlemen‚Äôs cases you might already know some people that would like to buy your property as you work in a certain societal circle, but good realtors and brokerages will bring in clients from all over the world not just the local market. Those leeches in the market like Zerow and Redtard like to charge realtors extra and photographers and basically milk everyone for using the MLS system through them, I personally wouldn‚Äôt deal with any of them it is the realtors and MLS that are going to bring you the listings in the end and the realtors are on straight commission they don‚Äôt sell no one gets paid. Now as the property owner them raising your assets price is a good thing not a bad thing. Yes you need to be able to afford to purchase but once you have your foot in the door and are generating equity you want your assets to go up and value so that your investment grows. Would you gentlemen investing in VC work hard if you could not profit, there has to be a reward for expertise and knowledge, or why build businesses? Now I appreciate you gentlemen are in the US and your market is sketchy in many areas mostly because of your banking, state, and fed rules etc.. but in Canada Real Estate is highly regulated, the banking system is extremely safe.. so it is one of the greatest investments going. Without great realtors houses would sit, people in trouble would lose everything, and you would rely on faceless Tech companies who could give a crap as long as they are monopolizing with their own system and profiting. They could care less about the realtors buyers or sellers as long as they milk their chunk from you, and at the end of the day when Zerow becomes king they would jack you with rates till we would be back to where you started but with someone who is not only incentivized to sell your property but to also get you the most amount of money they can. Why do buyers agents get paid also.. because they actually work harder than the selling agent. Some of their clients they have to show 30 homes to before they change their mind and want a place on the opposite side of town. Anyways that is my two cents.. like I said.. for me it doesn‚Äôt make a difference except that realtors will have your place ready to photos video and scan and I don‚Äôt have to charge return fees because the place was not ready to capture media. Usually it is staged too, cleaned, inspected. But then again if you don‚Äôt work with a realtor I will just charge more because of your incompetence as it will take us more time on site to do anything.",UgygADoe0lSXxXC5reZ4AaABAg

In fact, they invented the co-op concept over 100 years ago, and it has been a mandatory component of their five year Engineering program since then. Cooperative education offers students and employers the invaluable opportunity to test drive each other, while helping students to pay their way through college. Every engineering and tech/science undergrad program should have a mandatory work component to help students figure out which area of their profession is the best fit...and more importantly the areas that are NOT a good fit. Would love to see you guys use your platform to help steer education, both at the high school and college levels, in a direction that better prepares kids for a fulfilling and successful career.

NASA and Congress scratch one-another's backs to keep its budgets approved. SpaceX, by threatening NASA's slow, expensive, basically useless SLS program has been threatening representative's precious PORK SUPPLY.

Does the government have a role in protecting the 99.999% from the 0.0001%???  What tools should they be allowed to use??,Ugyodni-7F5Xui9yUXB4AaABAg

Afshar reportedly placed an order for a special type of glass that isn't all that easy to procure amid supply chain constraints, and told staff it was for a secret project.

That someone as smart as JCal still ""hopes"" that the NYT is making honest mistakes makes me think many people refuse to clue in to the reality that mainstream media today offer a complete disregard for factual reality in favor of shaping a political narrative, or better yet, a narrative that favors one of their few remaining sponsors.",UgyiGUFW_tjRgqBklM14AaABAg

Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want, our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much, and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity.

When challenged @46:01, he backtracks and cowers. He's less obnoxious now because his viewership is not driven by ratings driven by it. Tucker says that there will be cohesion when immigrants and minorities fall in line with the prevailing majority, which is white. He doesn't want the rich to address the fundamental issues in society that lead to inequality, but rather have the rich do charity to help the poor and leave it at that. He blames PE wives for all the problems in America but doesn't lay any blame at the feet of their husbands who accumulated incredible wealth starting from a place of privilege and often at the expense of those less privileged.

"CO2 makes up .04% of the atmosphere.  It is statistically impossible for it to have an effect on climate.  The only gas that has a significant effect on climate is methane emissions and the vast majority of it is released from the ocean floor and other natural means which are completely out of our control.  The point is, there is no factor that effects global temperature that we could have any statistically significant effect on. Anyone who believes different is a quack, is mislead by irrelevant data, or is a paid shill who benefits financially from the false ideas being spread.",Ugy_weabvSmiudRuQGx4AaABAg

You'd think anyone with your views would be in favor of declaring war on them to stop their attacks on the climate or risk climate apocalypse in 9 years. In reality, we are one of the few countries of our size that has massively REDUCED its pollution in the last several decades. You should go back and read about how NYC and LA were covered in toxic smog in the 60s, to the point where people actually died acutely from it. The fact is, you're not serious about your climate views. You want Americans' quality of living to suffer without forcing other countries to do the same, when their rivers are literally used as toilets and garbage dumps. If we cut our carbon emissions to zero in the US, the problem (to the extent the climate is measurably influenced by man-made carbon emissions) will still persist because we're not even the biggest polluters in the world and no other country is on board with making their population suffer.

Germany's ""national socialist"" platform is the only system that addresses all of the concerns being expressed in conversations like these. Especially when you consider the benefits of one of its primary components, the abolition of usury, which enables an entire class of people to rapidly rise to the top by merely profiting off of the success of a small number of people, and off of the desperation and financial necessities of a much larger group of people.

When you are the type of person who gets joy from giving you are on the way to true happiness. The problem is that if these people had that kind of mindset they would never have reached the success they have. They‚Äôd have been giving it to help others long before their billions. Think of the Charles Dickens story ‚ÄúThe Christmas Carol‚Äù. The reason it was so good is the rich miser sees the error in his ways and changes to a kind giving man.

From a psychoanalytic stand point, I wonder if his mental illness is congenital or the accretion of belaboring so much hate and division for decades.  Probably both, it's usually nature and nurture.  And for Sacks, who is always the brilliant voice of reason, to hold Tucker on a pedestal, is very paradoxical.  Sacks needs some sun and sleep.  He looks really run down.

I know he is quite good at non-stop talking out of his arse, but I'm not exactly sure how you 4 could let him continue unchecked and unchallenged with such bizarre and untrue statements. While he did have some solid points to make (especially about his international travels and  how different cultures around the world are succeeding even while our media says they are not), his glib lies and false statements about everything else was hard to bear.

I didn't watch him much on Fox, but he seemed to play the role by saying whatever his audience generally wanted to hear.  Heard a few interesting broader observations, a few batshit crazy statements (Nixon did nothing wrong, global warming is not impactful and is an invented problem).  Tucker comes across though as caring about what people think of him more than most in media and despite disturbing climate views, advocacy for a prison state, and past extreme war-mongering (""unreconstructed Republican"" was an interesting phrase by Sacks) seems somewhat likable. I feel I know a few personality types such as his; always presenting a tidy digestible explanation for even the broadest of mechanistic phenomenon.

For an informed person, you can just roll your eyes in this interview, but many over the years couldn't emotionally compartmentalize his sensationalism for advertisers, which is my problem with this guy. He is smarter and had a huge platform for change. In his time at Fox, he neither held back the onslaught of liberalism, nor helped to move the country forward.

At the end on the climate issues. I think you need to read the in literature. Not even it says anything about drastic climate catastrophe. If the most likely to major issues come up are looking at 2 Celsius rise in fifty years and they even they admit the limitations of the models and bias nearly all have towards worst case. No doubt Co 2 is a concern but it's not even the most obvious factor. Wealth generation is the most likely resource to allow us to be able to come up with the strategies that can tackle climate and poverty and population issues.

"_‚òÖ:_ I believe we are meant to be like Jesus in our hearts and not in our flesh. But be careful of AI, for it is just our flesh and that is it. It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God's Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith (in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won't last forever). To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of our body and also our spirit in hell fire, we should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. Our prove text is taken from the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21. Let us watch and pray...

I respect his opinion; it is his right, and that‚Äôs why this country is so great, but it is such a hypocritical argument to say that he is a native and feels betrayed because of how the government is treating their people. So many years have passed since enslaved people were a thing since the NATIVE AMERICANS were swept from their land that people forget what happened. Let‚Äôs not forget when the US also interfered with the politics in Central and South America for their benefit, which is why some of the countries never got a chance to develop. Sadly, many people have to leave their houses with just one shirt in their bags, maybe a picture or two, and something to remind them of home. They come here to work and have a better life, and just because some of them are stupid and do dumb things, they target all of us. I have been told to go back to your country; I have been looked at like I am nothing, and yet I am still fighting to have a better life and try to help anyone who needs the help‚Äîno matter what race, language, or color you are.

"1:28:28 here goes Friedberg going after the poorest of us. There‚Äôs a reason there‚Äôs social security and ‚Äúentitlements‚Äù. First, most of the working classes pays additional tax for that their entire working lives. And what did we get before it was instituted? The great depression! I do agree we should cut government spending. How about all the free money going to military corps? How about all the useless ‚Äúscience‚Äù grants? We can keep some and the most important, but I guarantee there‚Äôs trillions in bloat and grife and nothing more than welfare to the top worthless elite that are not capable of a real job.

"A big reason for Israeli hostility towards Palestinians is demographics. The high birth rate of Palestinians guarantees that they will be a majority. Thus,  a non-apartide single, democratic state is out of the question. BUT, this reasoning overlooks the fact that as a people become prosperous, its birthrate goes DOWN. Given a chance to live in a one-state democracy and prosper, might not end up totally dominating Israelis and determining the country's policies.",UgyIyAXUchJk0cS4p-h4AaABAg

"On Sack's ""populism"" @ 1:40:00 - The elites want the border opened because they need the cheap labor to work in their factories, on their farms, to cook in their restaurants.  The elites want endless wars because war is a cash cow if you are a military/defense business owner.  Globalization and exporting jobs and industry to China was all done in the name of profits--American businesses sold out their own country for short-term gain.  These things should not be hard to understand.  Everything is about power/money/control.

"What Tucker's saying is something we all know and feel intrinsically--it's human psychology that when we are left to our own devices we destroy ourselves--when we are not pre-occupied with survival, when we are complacent, when the mind is idle, the mind becomes vulnerable to parasitic thoughts.  This is why the wealthiest without real work to ground them are most apt to lose mental stability and become unhinged.  Many examples of kings, emperors, rulers, of various ethnicities who have gone mad/insane, except in this era it's the ultra wealthy and complacent.",Ugw_d-d2uA6l1QyPdvN4AaABAg

"I think the decrease in population in Japan is more of a result of the number of social phenomenon.  Up until 80s, the Japanese ""media"" was more worried about world overpopulation and world starvation coming from it.  Then after the bubble economy in late 80s and early 90s there,  spoiled young people didn't want to take responsibility of starting a family, especially women.  Back then, the guys in Japan were incentivized to get married because if they were single, they might not get promoted to more a ""responsible"" role.  Women being spoiled by their parents and the society didn't want to be house wives.  So staying single sort of started more by women there.  Then around 2000, things got reversed, meaning now guys didn't want to start a family because raising kids in Japan was expensive and their salary was being stagnate, so it wasn't a good ""deal"" for them to get married and be a breadwinner.  It's a first world and stagnate matured economy phenomenon.  The US is a bit of an exception because it's a country of immigrants, so their social phenomenon is not always a first world kind - It's more mix for better or worse.",UgwX4hRC8oQaMnwJOyZ4AaABAg

In America today, you can transcend morality and truth if you are rich and famous regardless of the impact of your behaviour.  Elon Musk, Phucker Carlson, Donald Trump, and Sam Blackman Fried all come to mind as examples of ""fame makes right.""

Are you kidding me? Not only that but not one of the guys asked him anything about all of the looney tune and solidly disproven stupid stuff he has said on air over the years. Instead it was all softballs and riffing with little substance. And lastly, it is clear that this was really a long plug for his show on X, for X and Elon Musk.

Suddenly you no longer have a goal because you already have your needs/wants completely satisfied or a phone call away; which is a problem because it means that is the only thing you were looking for to begin with. It also distorts your view of the world, I believe it makes you naive as well, because you don't feel the pressures that people in less prosperous circumstances feel, where bad actors, laziness and vice will definitely profit from naive filantropic endeavors.",UgzVAAgz0O8TZcT6uex4AaABAg

Is it firstly based on altruism, tech advancement,  or $$‚ùì In fact, some of the board may have significant reservations about his character now - so much so that they, with Helen's prompting, they made some rash decisions (not necessarily wrong) that they didn't have the mettle to follow through with, or handle considering the maturity of Sam's skills.  A close friend of mine (an engineer currently playing with AI models on the side), made this comment: ""Sam Altman has questionable character, he prioritises achieving his mission ahead of principle"".  Mark Zuckerburg with his Facebook business practices is an example of this, one only needs to look at how he behaved with different customers (clients, vs govt, vs media) in the past to see he was two-faced.   If you look at Sam in different presentations (company launches, vs interviews, govt inquiries) you will see the same thing [my friend said].  David, you (& the guys) rightly pointed out that Sam not only won but also won with an iron fist inside a velvet glove.  If he also is not a principled leader (in contrast to the current Elon Musk - which can be seen in the latest interview clip you showed, then this does not bode well.  This is not a question of what principles, but about whether principles come first.  It does not look good for the direction that OpenAI will track under Sam's leadership or where AI will go with OpenAI is currently leading it.  I don't think it is likely to be a coincidence that both Elon and Ilya Sutskever, who both are seen to be men of principle have had their relationship with Sam challenged.  ""Birds of a feather flock together"", with this in mind, one should also scrutinize the character of Greg Brockman Microsoft's Satya Nadella. It would be great if you guys would debate this question - nobody seems to be grappling with this question.  BTW this episode definitely in top 5.",UgxH_Ae1PjCCcxgP3Th4AaABAg

Why does an abundant society achieve less, focus less on solving some serious problems?

"If you've watched much of Tucker, you know he has a great knack for manipulating his audience. I've always felt he was a terrible person, but this interview really highlights just how deliberately evil he is. He blew me away @16:00 by how well he was able to humanize and empathize with those he disagrees with on the left, by highlighting the human nature of avoiding big problems. But rather than take his intelligence and insightfulness and use it to help bridge the gap between a growing political divide in our country, he has chosen to do the exact opposite. His willingness to sow discord in his massive audience when he knows the truth behind everything he says is much more complicated than he ever lets on is so morally reprehensible to me.",UgwE1NJxKi5FcHw3O2F4AaABAg

"Tucker Carlson is wonderful. Thank you for inviting him to be on your podcast. I haven't lost my sense of curiosity. I no longer trust that what I see, read or hear is valid information...The thing about the big advertisers ganging up on Elon Musk is they are pulling advertising most everyday Americans don't use, need or want. Comcast? Who? Since when do I need IBM? They made a huge mistake. They are, for the most part, monopolies in a contract-oriented specialized market (government, industries, big business) where they have little or no competition. They take no interest in world events. Elon Musk went to Gaza offering to help. He tried to help Ukraine by providing the access to Starlink. He tried to prevent actions that could have lead to WWIII by refusing to allow Starlink to be used to target the Russian Black Sea fleet. He took a lot of criticism for all of this, unfairly in my opinion. Which hot shot whozit from Disney or any of the other mega corporations have done the same?

"I want to address the point made at 10:39 : I love this podcast and Tucker and no one should be mobbed for their political views, but I live in Maine where Tucker has his vacation house. Tucker complains about being unfairly confronted. I would never confront Tucker for his political views, but if I ever see the man I will personally confront him to tell him his property has pissed off a lot of local landowners, specifically because he hires plows to shovel his property's snow onto local snowmobile trails. To be clear, Tucker insists he keeps a 'green lawn' in Maine winter -- this is the equivalent of insisting Alaska be free of ice. He pays a LOT to constantly shovel snow off his property so he can maintain a lawn in the middle of January, at the expense of the local trails he dumps all his crap on.",UgxEIdhymYlqBCcLyUh4AaABAg

A certain type of women he said but the over whelming impression was it's women. He veered back to that when he alluded to population decline. Here is a news flash. You asked what a majority of Americans agree on. 1) By huge margins they believe women should have the right to their own medical decisions including abortion. They agree that religion should have no place in the running our country. We agree on a lot of things but of course he would not mention that. Also no mention of why he really got fired. He went on the air and made statements which in private he knew were lies.

"One of my favorite topics that was covered was that there‚Äôs prosperity causing a huge attachment to ideals that on a relatively grand scale could be I considered realistically unimportant. And I agree‚Ä¶ to an extent. It‚Äôs so important to look at underdeveloped societies‚Ä¶ societies which are not dominated by technology, which still live in what we would consider archaic governance, and archaic ideologies‚Ä¶ many of those societies still settle conflict through war. Prosperity growth after WWII brought about cohesion for a while, we were growing in productivity and prosperity‚Ä¶ and peace. And then we reached a point where our nation became one of the most technologically advanced, families have cars, every person has a smart phone, we build into our budgets luxuries now. So what I‚Äôm really observing is the requirement for balance between desire for excess, and prosperity being used not as a tool of excess, but as a tool to bring peace. Maybe that‚Äôs a fools errand but to me there‚Äôs gotta be a balance.",UgyUprUxX6DftN0UitN4AaABAg

I have been a target of my father's loathing so much so that the more millions I got into the business the worse the situation got. He was so terrified with the success of meritocricy within the company, which is mainly because he preferred ""Yes Sir"" people around him so that he feels like a King of an Empire, that he ended up destroying the business 3 years after the money flowed in - it was too much too quick that generated so much loathing, it was totally insane.

I have trouble with Tucker because he rlies too much on his own opinions to come to his conclusion about things where scientific data shows ua what the reality actual is.

"I like these interview episodes, but with all in summit and guests, it‚Äôs been nearly two months without just a regular episode. I kinda miss that, so much happened in that time.

So at 38:00 Tucker is advocating a 100% or 1 billion dollars tax rate????? because obviously having too much is killing billionaires....unless this rule only applies to us plebs and all the millionaires and billionaires get to keep their shit. Reason diabetes skyrockets is because of disgusting processed foods and influx of suger that becomes abundant.

Can't believe I'm going to say this - thanks for this episode! This is going to explain a whole lot to europeans why america is heading where it's heading... and make us build bunkers in our backyards.

"Influencers and powerful people like all of you could unite and actually do something instead of talking and talking. Put massive surveys all together and start compiling public opinion to show what people really care about. Everybody talks and talks and ask others what to do but it‚Äôs just talking. Tree or four big podcasts might not be enough but it will inspire others to collaborate and sum their audiences. You see a lot common ideas and values in huge podcasts, lots of personalities that don‚Äôt collaborate for a greater good of this country and humanity. It‚Äôs just opinions and hoping their points of view will make people change but cero action",UgzntZvwuYmVw-AuM0x4AaABAg
"Tribalism always amazes me because the people in those tribes are so brainwashed by the echo chamber they live in, from politics, to football, to unions to civil wars etc etc. Education perhaps is the only way to open minds with the caution of not relying on lecturers and teachers that control your views rather than allowing you to question your views.",UgxqbD2nt23GkzxMSzx4AaABAg
